# Book Reader App

## Overview
Book Reader App is a web application built using Next.js that allows users to upload and read books in PDF format. It uses NextAuth for authentication and AWS for cloud storage, ensuring secure access to user-uploaded content.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-out using NextAuth.
- **Book Upload**: Users can upload books (PDF format) to AWS storage.
- **Book Reading**: Read books directly within the app using an embedded PDF viewer.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based framework)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (for PDF file storage)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for user data and book metadata)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Deployment**: Vercel / AWS (Optional)
